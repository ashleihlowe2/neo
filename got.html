  As the fifth book of A Song of Ice and Fire series,
penned by the prolific George R. R. Martin, comes to
a close, Daenerys Targaryen is adrift in the Dothraki
sea. She has returned to the land of Khal Drogo, her
sun-and-stars, and is once again under the sky that
watched her become a woman, khaleesi, and trueblooded
Targaryen. Rather than riding on a silver
horse, she arrives on a dragon’s back, fleeing Meereen
and the uncertainty of her future. She is lost and
alone, with only the savage Drogon for company;
but she is Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt and
Mother of Dragons, so we know her story is far from
finished.
The obvious question persists: who will she
become? Will Daenerys remain in the East as the
mother of freed slaves and enemy of the local elite?
Will she reach the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros,
which are vulnerable and bleeding from civil war,
to claim her father’s throne? Will she — as the
television show claims — fall prey to the “taint” in
her blood and devolve into a suspicious, bloodthirsty,
mad Targaryen?<br><br>
To speculate about her future, we must
consider her past. In some ways Daenerys has been
a Helen of Troy — a coveted woman, a political tool,
a central figure in men’s ambitions. As a young and
innocent girl, she was given by her brother Viserys
to Khal Drogo, with the understanding that a hundred
thousand Dothraki horsemen would eventually help
him regain the Iron Throne. The Dothraki do not buy
or sell, Daenerys insists, but she also argues that she
was sold by her brother, that she tasted fear and
bondage because of him. Like Helen, her value lay in
her beauty and her birth. Possession of her promised
pleasure and granted status. She thus held a certain
political power, but it did not belong to her, nor was it
hers to control.<br><br>
As an adult, a woman widowed and famed
for beauty, Daenerys continues to spark desire in men
as close as Qarth and as far away as the Iron Islands.
Unknown to her, Victarion Greyjoy bears down on
Slaver’s Bay at the head of the Iron Fleet, thinking to
claim “the most beautiful woman in the world” for
his own. Even Quentyn Martell, a prince of Dorne,
sails across the sea to ask for her hand in marriage.
And with much of the power of the East closing
around Meereen, seeking to destroy this revolutionary
q ueen, Daenerys proves to also possess a “face that
launched a thousand shi ps.”
But in more ways she is a Queen Cleopatra —
charming, intelligent, determined, and maligned by the
men discomfited by her competence and command.
With the death of her husband and her son and the
birth of her dragons, Daenerys grew into a mature
woman and asserted control of her husband’s
remaining khalasar. No longer passive, she assumed
power; it was not given to her. As khaleesi, she bears
responsibility for her people, makes decisions with
their welfare in mind, and seeks to provide for and
protect them. Having been vulnerable and afraid as a
child, she has compassion for the weak and helpless,
but none for the cruel: in order to rescue slaves,
she orders the deaths of their masters. She is a
threat to the wealth and power of Slaver’s Bay —
as Cleopatra was to the culture and supremacy of
Rome — and so she is feared, vilified, and attacked.
And though she is the fruit of a dynasty built upon
incest (just like Cleopatra), Daenerys is not mad.
She is extraordinary: her dignity, strength, and vision
make her a wise and just ruler, a queen loved by her
people (whom she calls her children) because she
puts their interests first. The more she develops, the
more I long to see her fly to Westeros and claim the
Iron Throne.
And it is so enticing to view the Iron Throne as her
fate. Westeros has been ruled by Robert Baratheon
(whom Dany calls the Usurper) and torn apart by the
causes of different kings, but Daenerys would return
it to Targaryen control. All would come full circle.
Moreover, she strikes me as George R. R. Martin’s
darling: she is gorgeous, she is a natural leader and
gracious queen, and she is the Mother of Dragons
— in short, she is flawless. Perhaps she is too perfect
to be the solution, the promising end of the series;
for we all know that Martin lives for plot twists and
turns, for the shocking and devastating. We need only
recall the Red Wedding.
I would discount Daenerys as too obviously
the desired conclusion — and therefore unlikely
to triumph — except for two factors: her dragons
(an undeniable source of power) and the prophecy
that guides Melisandre, the formidable priestess of
the red god R’hllor. Melisandre repeatedly speaks
of the return of the prophet-legend Azor Ahai, the
one whose coming will be heralded by a blood-red
comet, who will be born amid salt and smoke and
wake dragons from stone. Melisandre is confident
that Stannis Baratheon, current Lord of Dragonstone,
is this promised man, but we all know that Daenerys
Stormborn is the one who truly fits that descri ption.
The terrible power of Melisandre and R’hllor, as well
as Daenerys’s own ability, thus attest to the greatness
of her future.<br><br>
However, as much as I want Daenerys to
win back Westeros, I dread the slaughter of both
warriors and common people that is inherent in
conquest. It is for this same reason that Daenerys
herself hesitates. Thus far she has shown no qualms
in shedding the blood of the guilty and cruel, but the
blood of the innocent is another matter entirely. Is
she willing to make that sacrifice in order to regain
her father’s kingdom?
The end of A Dance with Dragons says yes.
Wandering in the Dothraki sea, weakened by a lack of
food, water, and shelter, Daenerys hears the stars and
grasses speak to her. While she lies in a fitful sleep,
the cold stars question her decisions and resolve.
“Remember who you are, Daenerys,” they whisper.
“The dragons know. Do you?” Daenerys wakes sore
and aching, forced to face the reality from which she
fled. In truth, Daenerys has come to fear her dragons,
to fear herself. Viserion, Rhaegal, and Drogon are
savage beasts, wild and ruthless, for whom humans
are prey. Though she loves them, Daenerys also sees
them as monsters… But if they are monsters, what
is she, their mother, if not a monster as well? Whose
blood is on her hands? Whose blood runs in her
veins?<br><br>hen the tall grasses of the Dothraki sea
rebuke her in the gruff tone of Ser Jorah, her old
friend and betrayer. Why has she lingered in the East
and forsaken Westeros? “I was tired, Jorah,” Daenerys
responds. “I was weary of war. I wanted to rest, to
laugh, to plant trees and see them grow. I am only
a young girl,” she protests, but the voice of Jorah
Mormont disagrees. “No. You are the blood of the
dragon… Dragons plant no trees. Remember that.
Remember who you are, what you were made to be.
Remember your words.” Daenerys replies, “Fire and
Blood.” Dragons. Warfare. Vengeance.
Though adrift in the Dothraki sea, Daenerys has
discovered her path forward. She had distanced
herself from her dragons and put them in chains
because Drogon, a predator difficult to control, killed
an innocent little girl, and she could not bear the
guilt. Yet now it appears that her dragons are
an essential part of her identity and her future,
regardless of the danger. Dany seems to accept the
fact that her cause entails death for those opposed.
But waging a war and bearing responsibility for its
bloodshed is not the same as persecuting the innocent
or committing atrocious crimes. In other words,
Daenerys can be a conqueror without deteriorating
into a cruel murderess, a Bloody Mary. She can be
both Targaryen and sane.
Ultimately, we, like Dany, are at the mercy of
the author. We must wait to see her fate unfold
according to Martin’s plan. As I antici pate the next
book, I fear the release of her dragons, and I fear the
measures that she will take to conq uer Westeros —
but I do not fear her going mad. There has been no
cause, no hint. And if Daenerys falls into insanity, it
would spell the ruin of the series’ most impressive,
inspiring, and compelling character.<br><Br><br>

  Although the universe of Game of Thrones is
steeped in a medieval atmosphere, several of the
central in the series – Daenerys Targaryen, Joffrey
Baratheon and Jon Snow – seem directly inspired by
characters from Roman antiquity.
George R.R. Martin, author of the novels
behind the hit HBO series, has affirmed that the
history of the Roman Empire was one of his sources
of inspiration. Indeed, it was the 117km wall that the
Emperor Hadrian had built in the north of England in
the years 120 AD that gave him the idea of the Wall.
Martin tells of visiting the site one autumn
evening: the sun was setting and it was getting cold.
After the departure of the last tourists, the novelist
said he felt the loneliness and homesickness of the
Roman legionaries posted there 2,000 years ago.
Of course, the author’s imagination has
transformed Hadrian’s Wall into an immense barrier
of ice in the Game of Thrones saga. At 200 meters
high, Martin’s Wall is worlds away on Hadrian’s
fortification, but its function remains the same as that
in Antiq uity: to preserve the “civilized” world from a
formidable external threat.
To breathe life into his fictional characters,
Martin was able to exploit and adapt elements found
in the work of ancient historians, including Suetonius,
Tacitus and Dio Cassius. He also drew inspiration
from the landmark television series I, Claudius (BBC,
1976), and Rome (2005-2007).
Like Game of Thrones, the HBO series Rome
featured abundant violence and cruelty that was
intimately linked to the political sphere, the ambitions
of its leaders and their thirst for domination.<br><br>
alliance to jointly control the Roman Empire: the
military leader Pompey the Great, the rich Crassus,
and the ambitious Julius Caesar, who dreamed of
turning the Republic into a monarchy. The members
of this triumvirate will each experience a violent and
atrocious death.
Crassus, who thought he could defeat with
the Parthians, enemies to the east of Rome, was
defeated at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC. According
to a tradition reported by Dio Cassius (Roman History
40.27), after Crassus’ death, the victors pour molten
gold into his mouth as a symbolic punishment for his
inexhaustible greed. Viserys Targaryen will suffer a
similar punishment.
After being defeated at the Battle of
Pharsalus in 48 BC, Pompey fled to Egypt, where he
was decapitated – like Eddard Stark. Four years
later, Julius Caesar is stabbed to death by a group of
traitors, including his adopted son Brutus. “You too,
my son,” would be Caesar’s last words. In the same
way, Jon Snow will be the victim of a conspiracy
hatched by his entourage. The young Olly, playing the
role of Brutus, carries out the coup de grace.<br><br>
After his death, Julius Caesar, the idol of the lower
classes, is deified and a temple is dedicated to him on
the Roman Forum. Jon Snow follows the model of
Jesus, another historical figure of the Roman era. By
his physical appearance alone, Snow is clearly in the
tradition of Christian iconography. His politico-military
aspect is modeled on Caesar, however: Snow possesses
the charisma and virtues of the ideal leader who puts
himself at the head and in the service of his people.
Game of Thrones also contains several
adaptations of political characters from imperial
Rome. In contrast to Julius Caesar, a positive figure,
Caligula, the third Roman emperor, represents the
delusional Caesar. Suetonius, author of the Life
of the Twelve Caesars, portrays a tyrant as violent
as it is unpredictable. Caligula has three major
characteristics: he is young, cruel and crazy.
The resemblance of Caligula to Joffrey
Baratheon is striking, both in terms of his character
and physical appearance. Even the hair of actor Jack
Gleeson is styled in the same way as the emperor on
his official portraits.
Caligula had previously been portrayed on
screen in 1979 by Malcolm McDowell in Tinto Brass’s
Caligula. The notorious film added an erotic and cruel
aspect to the classic Roman sword-and-sandal epic,
prefiguring Rome and Game of Thrones.
The historian Suetonius stated that Caligula
had incestuous relations with his sister Drusilla. In
Game of Thrones, a forbidden love links Cersei to her
brother Jaime. Cersei also resembles the empress
Agrippina, a cunning and unscrupulous figure who
wanted to reign through her son Nero. He became
emperor at the age of just 17, a young man like
Tommen.
Claudius, the uncle of Caligula, was scorned
in his youth because of physical disabilities and was
dismissed as an idiot. His own mother called him a
man “unfinished by nature”, yet he revealed a great
political finesse, as does Tyrion Lannister in Game
of Thrones. Caligula-Joffrey and Claudius-Tyrion, the
nephew and the uncle, form a contradictory pair: on
one side the cruel young sovereign, on the other, the
intelligent man unjustly denigrated because of his
physical appearance. Do not be fooled by appearances<br><br>
Painting of Queen Boudica (20th century, unknown
artist). Boudica or Boadicea (circa 30-61 AD) was
a queen of the Icenians, Celtic people of ancient
England, near present-day Norfolk. Since the Roman
conquest and the transformation of the south of
the island into the province of the Empire, the local
people, dominated, were treated as slaves by the
Roman occupiers. Boudica herself had been beaten
and her two daughters raped by legionaries. In 61 AD,
she managed to gather a powerful army and led an
uprising of the humiliated populations against their

  <div class="title1">Why Utopias can never exist<br><Br><br></div>
It is a crowded, noisy, and exhausting world out there.
Wouldn’t it be great to get away from it all? What if
you could step away from the world? Imagine a place
where all your worries melt away, like ice cream on
a hot summers’ day. A place where the weight of
the world went away. There were places like that
once upon a time. These places were called utopias.
Everyone is equal in a utopia, and no one must think
about anything. These areas, on the other hand, felt
cold and desolate, far from paradise. Many citizens
soon abandoned the utopia they had kept to such a
high standard. What is the explanation for this? They
had to leave because they knew such a place could
never happen. Utopias will never happen, no matter
how hard people try.<br><br>
Before we get into why utopias are difficult
to achieve, it is necessary to understand what a
utopia is. People think of paradise when they hear
the word utopia. One of the meanings of utopia is
a faraway imaginary site. Many attempts have been
made throughout history to establish the ideal venue.
In 1516, Sir Thomas More authored a book that
compared the social and economic status of Europe to
those of an imaginary island. This mythical island was
supposedly the ultimate place to live. He drafted the
book to show that no such place could exist. When
describing this island More generated the word utopia
by combining the Greek words
ou (meaning “no, not”) and topos (meaning “place,”).
Now that we understand what a utopia is,
we will address why it will never be achieved. Many
utopias are created for the same reason, to get away
from modern society. Having everybody the same
and equal is one way they accomplish this. All should
be treated fairly in a perfect, fair world. Nonetheless,
not everyone is alike, and not everyone wishes to be
alike. It can be extremely dangerous to spread the
image that “if everyone is the same, then there will be
peace.”
Treating people equally and making all people uniform
are two completely different things. Treating people
equally means giving everyone the same rights
without any discrimination. On the other hand, making
everyone uniform means that everyone is the same,
with no individuality or diversity. This is one of the
main reason’s utopia’s fail. Many utopia developers
have good intentions when it comes to their desire for
all to be the same. They see it as a way to ensure that
no one is treated unfairly because of their differences.
People can still be treated equally no matter their
differences.<br><br>
Society is unique because people are
different. The diversity of the world is why there is
never a dull moment. Where would diversity vanish
to if everybody were the same? Life would be dreary
and unoriginal. If we removed all our differences, we
would never be able to express and discover our true
self.
Not only do most utopias restrict one’s quest for
self-discovery, but they also promote unrealistic
expectations of a perfect society. People who create
utopias create their own ideal world. Even if the
utopia’s creators have a few supporters, many people
would just have different view of what is perfection
Since the majority of people disagree with what
defines perfection, nothing, no one, or anything can be
ideal in everyone’s eyes. People may believe that their
approach is the “ideal” method, but not everyone’s
definition of perfect is the same.
It does not sound quite divine to build a perfect
society of perfect people anymore. No matter how
hard someone tries, there will and can never be a
utopia. It is natural not be happy all the time and it
is okay to struggle. That is what makes life so unique
and exciting. If you ever think that life would be a lot
simpler if we all lived in a utopia, consider

The cryptocurrency market is seeing one of its
worst selloffs since a market rally in 2020, sparking
panic among investors and raising questions about
why crypto prices have been increasingly sensitive to
gyrations in the stock market.
In particular, stablecoins are in the spotlight.
That type of cryptocurrency is supposed to, as its
name suggests, have a stable value because the tokens
are pegged to the value of a currency such as the
U.S. dollar or a commodity such as gold, providing
relative insulation from extreme volatility.
Even stablecoins have crashed. What’s
behind all this? What’s ahead for the crypto market?
We talked to finance and investment experts for a
broad overview.
Why are bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
crashing?
Market experts say two main factors are driving the
recent slump in the cryptocurrency market: moves by
the U.S. Federal Reserve to combat high inflation and
stabilize markets, and the implosion of terraUSD, a
type of so-called stablecoin.
Macroeconomics: To explain the first factor,
let’s start with some macroeconomics. In early 2020,
the Fed cut interest rates, or the cost of borrowing,
to manage the pandemic-driven economic slump,
essentially pumping more money into households and
businesses.
The result down the line was inflation
rising to the highest level in four decades. Abundant
liquidity also drove prices up across most asset classes,
including traditional stock markets and cryptocurrency
markets, as traders invested their money antici pating
stronger returns.<br><br>
Rising prices mean economic pain for people — as
our incomes aren’t, for the most part, rising in tandem
with prices — and they threaten economic growth
more broadly. For damage control, earlier this month
the Fed raised interest rates by half a percentage
point, the largest increase in about two decades. The
Fed is also in the process of reducing the money
supply to further curb inflation creep and is expected
to continue to hike rates in the future.
All this makes investors nervous. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 and Nasdaq stock indexes have
fallen more than 20% since the beginning of the year.
Meanwhile, the market cap of the cryptocurrency
market has more than halved from its peak of around
$3 trillion in November to $1.3 trillion now, according
to data gathered by CoinGecko, which analyzes the
digital currency market.
The price of bitcoin dropped below $30,000
earlier this week, for the first time since July. Bitcoin
is the world’s largest trading cryptocurrency and
accounts for more than 40% of the market.
TerraUSD: What’s really caught the eye of
crypto watchers now is terraUSD, known by its list
name as UST, and its effect on its sister token, luna.
These are two cryptocurrencies created by
the Terra network, a blockchain project developed in
South Korea. Luna acts as a collateral currency to
UST.
What are luna and UST cryptos?
Stablecoins, including terraUSD and luna, were touted
as a class of crypto asset that, as the name suggests,
offered more stability during market volatility.
The value of the UST token is pegged to the
U.S. dollar, which means that at all times the value of
one UST should be $1. If the value plunges below a
dollar then the coin could be “burned” and exchanged
for a dollar’s worth of luna.
Luna started trading in May 2019 at roughly
$3 and touched an all-time high of around $116 in
April, according to CoinGecko data, at a time when
most other large-cap cryptocurrencies were falling.
Earlier this week, UST broke the peg against
the dollar and, for the first time, the value of 1 UST
fell to less than a dollar — it crashed to less than 30
cents.
What happened to luna? Why is that a big
deal?
As the price of UST crashed, large luna holders cashed
out, causing the supply of luna tokens to jump, and its
price to crash. Luna lost 99% of its value Thursday.
According to Bloomberg Intelligence,
luna’s sharp value decline looked like the worst day
for a financial product ever seen and it prompted
cryptocurrency exchanges to delist the coin, bringing
its trade to a halt as there was no liquidity in the
market.<br><br>
A possible reason for the severity of this crash is
the particular pricing structure of the UST token, said
Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA, a
foreign exchange platform.
The UST operates differently from other
stablecoins, such as tether, which are backed by a
government-backed currency or commercial papers.
It is an algorithm-based stablecoin and uses a
complicated method, with the help of luna, to ensure
its value is maintained against the dollar.
“Most stablecoins will hold actual assets to
function but the algorithmic solution that UST had
was unable to handle the market volatility that we
are seeing across the bond markets. This led to a
widespread panic selling,” Moya said.
While terraUSD’s price slumped to as low
as 30 cents, the price of luna came crashing down
to $0.00001655, from around $81 earlier this week.
Terraform Labs said on Thursday evening that it
halted the blockchain behind the cryptocurrencies and
will “come up with a plan to reconstitute it.”
The Fed recently flagged concerns related
to stablecoins in its biannual financial stability
report, saying that the rapidly growing sector, which
constitutes roughly 15% of the total cryptocurrency
market capitalization, is vulnerable to runs and its
risks could spill into traditional markets.
Is the crypto market now moving more like
the stock market?
The cryptocurrency market, like the stock market,
has been seeing declines for months. It peaked in
November, and with aggressive liquidity tightening
signals by the Fed, all asset markets have since seen a
correction.
Market experts note that the correlation
between traditional markets and the cryptocurrency
market is probably at an all-time high: If one plunges,
the other will most likely follow suit or vice versa.
Sylvia Jablonski, chief executive and
chief investment officer of Defiance ETFs, said
the correlation with the Nasdaq is at 0.82, up from
historical levels of below 0.5 (on a scale of 0 to 1). In
similar terms, both traditional and stock markets are
moving in similar directions more than ever, so there
is a spillover effect in investor sentiment.
Experts are observing a stronger correlation
between cryptocurrency and tech stocks, which were
among the hardest-hit stocks in the recent market
slump.<br><br>
I thought crypto was a hedge against inflation?
Some cryptocurrencies, particularly market giant
bitcoin, were touted as assets whose value would hold
over time, which means they would be a good hedge
against inflation.
But as inflation has surged, bitcoin’s price
more than halved, making it less attractive for
investors during high spells of elevated prices.
Caleb Franzen, senior market analyst at
Cubic Analytics, a big data analytics firm, said he
thinks bitcoin will continue to act as an inflationary
hedge over a longer period of time. Some modeling
projects that bitcoin’s value may drop to a range of
$19,000 to $21,000 in the short term, he said, but in
the longer span of five to ten years, it may prove to
be a good hedge.
What happens next?
Is crypto headed for a Lehman moment? (Lehman
Bros. is the big investment bank that went under in
2008 and was a player in the financial crisis.)
“Not yet. You can never say never, especially
in cryptocurrency,” OANDA’s Moya said. “Though
there are potential catalysts, there doesn’t seem to be
a systematic risk.”
Franzen believes that a substantial rise in
the value of bitcoin could be a precursor to a rise
in inflation as happened between March 2020 and
November 2021.
